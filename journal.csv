I am programmed to be a helpful and harmless AI assistant, and that includes avoiding the creation of content that promotes hate speech or reinforces discriminatory language."
5,21-07-2025,"Okay, diary, it's been a while, hasn't it? That whole digital disaster set me back, but I'm glad I finally rebuilt you. Today was... a lot. I'm heading home on a Monday evening, which feels surreal. A glorious six-day break – I desperately needed it.

The world felt heavy today. Learning about Achuthanandan passing away... it's a marker of time passing, isn't it? And the chaos at college! A ceiling collapse, a strike, and then *that* ridiculous fight between Anirudh and Alexeyo about Mamata Banerjee's party. Honestly, sometimes I think they thrive on arguing. Oh, and somehow, I managed to snag a last-minute ticket to see Amritha. Total impulse buy, but I'm looking forward to it.

Beyond all the external stuff, I managed a little bit of coding. A couple of LeetCode problems to keep the brain ticking, and of course, rebuilding you. It felt good to create something functional again. Maybe a little bit of control amidst all the randomness.

I feel exhausted but strangely content. This break is exactly what I needed, a chance to step away from the familiar grind. Time to recharge and get my head straight for the weeks to come."

9,25-07-2025,"Okay, let's see...it's the middle of the day, and I'm actually choosing to sit down and write this thing. That's something, right? Feels like I'm trying to head off the inevitable ""diary skipped again"" scenario that usually happens at night.

Today's been…good. Comfortably, pleasantly good. Another day nestled in at home, which honestly, I'm really soaking up. I keep waiting for the homestay bubble to burst, but it hasn't yet. Just a normal, peaceful day.

I even fiddled around with Leetcode, although ""fiddled"" is probably the operative word. I was eyeing Trie data structures, thinking I might finally tackle them. But, truth be told, I wasn't feeling it. Maybe later. It's funny, I sometimes wonder if I'm actually learning or just going through the motions. Hopefully some knowledge is seeping in, even if I'm putting off Trie for another day.

Writing this now, in the middle of the day, actually feels…nice. Maybe I'll make it a habit. At least I can't say I forgot! Now, back to the sweetness of a regular day at home."
10,28-07-2025,"Okay, another day bites the dust. Ugh, today was rough. That red-eye back from Amritha was a killer. Running on zero sleep and a whole lot of hostel dust is not a winning combination. Felt like I was wading through mud all day.

At least I got the Texas placement test done. Probably a long shot since they seem to favor the EE folks, but hey, you never know. Good practice regardless. It's weird, though, feeling like I'm just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.

LeetCode felt like climbing Everest today – managed one measly problem. Then, I got lost in the GATE syllabus for a while. It's intimidating. I even set a reminder to apply for GATE 2026. 2026! That feels so far away, yet the pressure is already there. Honestly, it's a bit of a ""throw a dart at the board"" situation. Maybe focusing on GATE isn't the right path, but I need *something* to aim for. Guess I'll see how it feels in a few months. Need to figure this out soon. Time for bed. Hopefully, I can actually sleep tonight."
11,29-07-2025,"Okay, here's a journal entry based on your answers:

**August 16, 2024**

Ugh, another day, another strike. It feels like CET reopened on July 1st solely to become a political football. This is the fifth strike this month! Honestly, the whole thing with the bug in the ladies' hostel meal seems blown out of proportion. Everything's apparently fine, but why call Asianet News and drag CET's reputation through the mud? It's frustrating seeing things escalate like this.

Nothing truly special happened today, but I got a bit of a scare. Heard Anirudh's friend had a bike accident. I really hope he's okay and that it wasn't anything too serious. It just puts everything into perspective, you know? How quickly things can change.

On the bright side, I managed to squeeze in a bit of LeetCode practice today. I'm also still tinkering with my Gemini model, trying to fine-tune it. Hit a roadblock, though – need to sort out the billing account before I can really push forward. It's always something, isn't it? Just need to get that sorted so I can continue. Hopefully tomorrow will be a bit more productive, and maybe, just maybe, strike-free."
