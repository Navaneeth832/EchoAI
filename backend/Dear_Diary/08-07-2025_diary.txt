Yeah, a bit good. Relaxing, definitely. Today was... mellow. The highlight was, without a doubt, treating my friends at Fiery Box. The food was delicious, absolutely worth it. But what really struck me was the waiter. He was just so genuine and chill, a really refreshing attitude. It made the whole experience better. As for upskilling, just a couple of Leetcode problems. Not a bad day overall, a little treat, some brain exercise, and good company. Feels... good.
