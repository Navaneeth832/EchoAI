Okay, here's a journal entry based on your answers:

**August 16, 2024**

Ugh, another day, another strike. It feels like CET reopened on July 1st solely to become a political football. This is the fifth strike this month! Honestly, the whole thing with the bug in the ladies' hostel meal seems blown out of proportion. Everything's apparently fine, but why call Asianet News and drag CET's reputation through the mud? It's frustrating seeing things escalate like this.

Nothing truly special happened today, but I got a bit of a scare. Heard Anirudh's friend had a bike accident. I really hope he's okay and that it wasn't anything too serious. It just puts everything into perspective, you know? How quickly things can change.

On the bright side, I managed to squeeze in a bit of LeetCode practice today. I'm also still tinkering with my Gemini model, trying to fine-tune it. Hit a roadblock, though â€“ need to sort out the billing account before I can really push forward. It's always something, isn't it? Just need to get that sorted so I can continue. Hopefully tomorrow will be a bit more productive, and maybe, just maybe, strike-free.
