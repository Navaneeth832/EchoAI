Another day, another round of lectures until 3 pm. College is such a routine sometimes. But today wasn't *just* another day. Professor Narasimhan's little stunt has really gotten under my skin. Randomly selecting students for that software program? It felt so arbitrary, so unfair. Pure favouritism, plain and simple. It stings, but honestly, it's lit a fire in me. I'm determined to upskill myself, to get so good that those chosen few won't even be a blip on my radar. I've started diving into the world of LLMs with Hugging Face. I even tried to whip up a quick Google Form autofiller, but quickly realized it's not the simple copy-paste job I initially thought. It'll take some actual work, which is fine. I'll tackle it later. For now, it's fuel. Let Narasimhan have his favorites. I'll have something even better.
