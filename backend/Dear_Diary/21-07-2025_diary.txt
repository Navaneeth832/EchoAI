Okay, diary, it's been a while, hasn't it? That whole digital disaster set me back, but I'm glad I finally rebuilt you. Today was... a lot. I'm heading home on a Monday evening, which feels surreal. A glorious six-day break â€“ I desperately needed it.

The world felt heavy today. Learning about Achuthanandan passing away... it's a marker of time passing, isn't it? And the chaos at college! A ceiling collapse, a strike, and then *that* ridiculous fight between Anirudh and Alexeyo about Mamata Banerjee's party. Honestly, sometimes I think they thrive on arguing. Oh, and somehow, I managed to snag a last-minute ticket to see Amritha. Total impulse buy, but I'm looking forward to it.

Beyond all the external stuff, I managed a little bit of coding. A couple of LeetCode problems to keep the brain ticking, and of course, rebuilding you. It felt good to create something functional again. Maybe a little bit of control amidst all the randomness.

I feel exhausted but strangely content. This break is exactly what I needed, a chance to step away from the familiar grind. Time to recharge and get my head straight for the weeks to come.
