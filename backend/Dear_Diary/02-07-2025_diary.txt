Another average day, I suppose. College classes officially kicked off, but most of them felt like a drag. Even Narasimhan's class, which started promisingly, lost its spark by the second period. But, you know, yesterday’s project idea… that's the real highlight. Right before drifting off to sleep, it just *clicked*. A 9/10 idea, I genuinely think. And the best part? It was all me. No ChatGPT, just pure, unadulterated brainstorming. I'm actually proud of myself for that. Today I mapped out the project roadmap and started chipping away at the skills I need. Also managed to squeeze in a LeetCode problem and applied for a couple of random internships on LinkedIn. Nothing special, just putting in the work. Trying to make something of these average days.
