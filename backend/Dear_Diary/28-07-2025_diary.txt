Okay, another day bites the dust. Ugh, today was rough. That red-eye back from Amritha was a killer. Running on zero sleep and a whole lot of hostel dust is not a winning combination. Felt like I was wading through mud all day.

At least I got the Texas placement test done. Probably a long shot since they seem to favor the EE folks, but hey, you never know. Good practice regardless. It's weird, though, feeling like I'm just throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.

LeetCode felt like climbing Everest today â€“ managed one measly problem. Then, I got lost in the GATE syllabus for a while. It's intimidating. I even set a reminder to apply for GATE 2026. 2026! That feels so far away, yet the pressure is already there. Honestly, it's a bit of a "throw a dart at the board" situation. Maybe focusing on GATE isn't the right path, but I need *something* to aim for. Guess I'll see how it feels in a few months. Need to figure this out soon. Time for bed. Hopefully, I can actually sleep tonight.
