Ugh, Saturday. Another one bites the dust. So incredibly long and boring. I didn’t even bother with a movie. The only highlight was going out for tea this evening, a brief escape from the four walls. Then, the obligatory second dinner with the crew, followed by the usual late-night chatter near college. We finally straggled back to the hostel at 10:10 PM.

Nothing truly special happened today, unless you count Jil’s sudden departure for that internship program. Professor Narasimhan, the sly fox, just plucked four random students from the class. No announcement, no warning. We'll have our revenge, though. Mark my words.

Tried to do some upskilling work, but the motivation just wasn't there. Still battling this stupid cold. I thought I'd at least make some progress on that voting system for my sister’s school, but I only managed to get halfway through. My brain felt like cotton. Maybe tomorrow will be more productive. Maybe.
