Another first day back at college down. Classes until 4, same old routine, and I'm completely wiped. It's funny how quickly the exhaustion sets in again. But something totally bizarre happened when I went for tea afterwards. This guy went absolutely ballistic at the bakery staff, accusing someone of spitting in his lime juice! He was proper shouting and swearing, demanding everyone check the CCTV. The whole place was in chaos, everyone crowding around to watch the drama unfold. It was so surreal. Made me think about how quickly things can escalate, and how unpredictable people can be. On a completely different note, I managed to squeeze in a few OpenCV tutorials for my project. Slowly but surely getting there, I suppose. Tiny steps, but progress nonetheless.
