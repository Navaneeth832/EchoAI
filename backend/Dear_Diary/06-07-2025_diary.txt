Pretty average Sunday, all told. Stayed in all day, save for a quick evening snack run for dosa and tea – always a comforting little ritual. I did manage to get that PPT done for the baby care hackathon, using Gamma AI. It felt…productive, I guess. But the truth is, I'm just not feeling it lately. No upskilling happening, zero motivation. College is just sucking the life out of me. I feel like I'm losing the plot, just floating along with no real direction. Need to figure this shit out.
