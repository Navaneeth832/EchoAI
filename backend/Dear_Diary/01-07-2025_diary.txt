Well, today was pretty much as expected. College started, and my first day was...average. One class, done. Got a haircut in the afternoon, which is probably the most exciting thing that happened. To be honest, nothing feels particularly special right now, just the usual routine. I did manage to tackle a couple of Leetcode problems on linked lists. Felt good to dust off those coding skills. Spent some time scrolling through LinkedIn and even brainstormed for a personal project idea, but nothing concrete came to mind. Maybe tomorrow inspiration will strike. Still, I guess just showing up and putting in the work is something.
