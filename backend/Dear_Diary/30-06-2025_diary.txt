Ugh, today was a rough one. College is breathing down my neck again. That "back-to-school" dread hit me like a ton of bricks this morning. It's funny how a month can feel like a lifetime. I got way too comfortable in my little bubble of freedom. This transition back to the grind is brutal. I really hope I adjust quickly, because right now, this whole thing feels suffocating.

Nothing special happened on the train, just the usual scenery blurring past the window. Honestly, the journey itself was part of the problem. It felt like I was being physically pulled back into the routine.

I did manage to finish that program I've been working on while I was travelling, which is something, I guess. A small victory amidst the chaos. Feels good to have at least accomplished something today.

I just wish this whole thing felt less... jarring. Maybe tomorrow will be better. Maybe.
